### Description
My standard, sanitized version of bash scripts. These are revised on a monthly 
basis as I move in different circles. Currently, These are primarily focused on
python development, building out useful documentation tools, tracking tasks in 
realtime situations.
### Installation
**The system is not quite ready for primetime, but, when it is finished**
- Verify the locations in the install and profile scripts match your installation
locations.
- Create a backup of your current files.
- Run the install script
- execute a new instance of bash to validate things work as expected.
### Usage
source .profile
